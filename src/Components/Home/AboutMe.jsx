                        Hello, I am Mohaiminul Islam and I am from Gazipur, Bangladesh. I&apos;m a passionate front-end developer who loves solving problems and creating engaging user experiences. I have one year of experience in web development, with a focus on frontend development using the MERN stack. I&apos;m proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, and I can also create RESTful APIs using Express.js and familiar with basics of MongoDB databases.

                        One of my best projects is Harlem Heartstrings, an online platform offering violin classes by top instructors. I built this project using React for the frontend, Express.js for the backend and MongoDB for the database. I implemented user registration and login features, role-based dashboards, payment system and seat availability updates.
                    </p>

                        I like to play strategy games when I get time. I also like to read all kinds of interesting articles and blogs. Definitely won&apos;t say no to a good fantasy novel.
